lefetch requirements:

- cron access
- php5
- sqlite

configuration:
in the top of lefetch.php you can set:
- the name of the sqlite database
- the target directory (where to store the files)
- and the feeds to watch

install, just run
$ ./lefetch/db.php

cron setup:
# will update feeds every 30 minutes
0,30 * * * * /path/to/lefetch.php


testing feature:
make sure your database is installed and you have feeds to test on in the
configuration file.

open a shell and type:
$ ./lefetch.php --debug

you will now get a bunch of information on what's going on while the process runs.
